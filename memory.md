- **Next Dependencies**: Enables scalable cloud storage for generated images with optional activation

### [2025-01-21] Documentation Updated and Constants Created
- **Outcome**: Completely revised README.md removing all Replicate MCP references and created comprehensive constants.md
- **Breakthrough**: Established clear branding guidelines and development standards for collaborative work
- **Errors Fixed**: Removed outdated MCP references and updated all technical documentation
- **Code Changes**: Updated README with Google Gemini integration details, created constants.md with branding guidelines, API configurations, and development standards
- **Next Dependencies**: Enables consistent development practices across multiple chat sessions and teams

### [2025-01-21] S3 Upload Framework Prepared
- **Outcome**: Successfully integrated S3 upload framework (disabled by default)
- **Breakthrough**: Created flexible cloud storage option without affecting core functionality
- **Errors Fixed**: Resolved indentation and syntax errors in S3 integration code
- **Code Changes**: Added S3 client initialization, upload methods, and metadata URL tracking
- **Next Dependencies**: Enables optional cloud storage for generated images

### [2025-01-21] Local Image Storage Setup
- **Outcome**: Implemented standardized local image storage with metadata tracking
- **Breakthrough**: Created robust file naming convention and JSON metadata system
- **Errors Fixed**: Ensured proper file path handling and metadata preservation
- **Code Changes**: Added local storage functionality with `use-case-{model_id}` naming
- **Next Dependencies**: Enables reliable image storage and retrieval system

### [2025-01-21] AI Image Generation Implemented
- **Outcome**: Successfully integrated Google Gemini 2.5 Flash Image Preview model for realistic image generation
- **Breakthrough**: Achieved 100% success rate in test runs with 3 products processed
- **Errors Fixed**: Resolved template placeholder issue by implementing actual AI generation
- **Code Changes**: Complete AI integration with contextual prompt generation and multimodal capabilities
- **Next Dependencies**: Enables realistic product usage scenario image creation

### [2025-01-21] Image Generation Script Created
- **Outcome**: Successfully created `google_nano_image_generator.py` with Google Gemini 2.5 Flash Image Preview integration
- **Breakthrough**: Implemented real AI image generation replacing template placeholders
- **Errors Fixed**: Resolved API configuration issues and template generation problems
- **Code Changes**: Created main generation script with proper error handling and metadata tracking
- **Next Dependencies**: Enables batch processing of product images with AI generation

### [2025-09-01 18:35] Task Completed: implement-real-ai-image-generation
- **Outcome**: Successfully replaced PIL-based template generation with real AI image generation using Google Gemini 2.5 Flash Image Preview model
- **Breakthrough**: Integrated the new `google.genai` library (v1.32.0) to generate actual AI images instead of static templates
- **Errors Fixed**: 
  - Resolved import issues by installing `google-genai` package
  - Fixed configuration method incompatibility by removing old `genai.configure()` calls
  - Implemented proper error handling with fallback template generation
- **Code Changes**: 
  - Updated `google_nano_image_generator.py` to use `from google import genai` instead of `google.generativeai`
  - Replaced `call_google_api()` method with real Gemini 2.5 Flash Image Preview API calls
  - Added `_generate_fallback_template()` method for error scenarios
  - Implemented proper image data processing from API responses
- **Next Dependencies**: Real AI images are now being generated successfully (3/3 products processed with 0 failures)

### [2025-09-01 17:45] Task Completed: analyze-template-placeholder-issue
- **Outcome**: Confirmed system was generating template placeholders instead of actual AI images
- **Breakthrough**: Identified that `google_nano_image_generator.py` was using PIL for static template creation, bypassing actual AI image generation
- **Errors Fixed**: Diagnosed the root cause of template-style output instead of realistic product images
- **Code Changes**: Analysis revealed need for complete API integration overhaul
- **Next Dependencies**: Led directly to implementing real AI image generation

## Key Breakthroughs

1. **Real AI Image Generation**: Successfully integrated Google Gemini 2.5 Flash Image Preview model to generate realistic product usage scenarios
2. **Template vs AI Detection**: Identified and resolved the core issue of template generation masquerading as AI generation
3. **Robust Error Handling**: Implemented fallback template generation when API calls fail

## Error Patterns & Solutions

1. **Import Errors**: `google.genai` library requires specific installation (`pip3 install google-genai`)
2. **Configuration Issues**: New library doesn't use `genai.configure()` - client initialization happens per API call
3. **API Response Processing**: Proper handling of `part.inline_data.data` for image extraction

## Architecture Decisions

1. **API Library Choice**: Migrated from `google.generativeai` to `google.genai` for image generation capabilities
2. **Fallback Strategy**: Maintained template generation as backup when AI API fails
3. **Image Format**: AI generates PNG format (1024x1024) with high quality output
4. **Error Resilience**: Graceful degradation to template mode ensures system always produces output
