### [2025-01-21 23:11] Task Completed: Create agent template prompt scaffolding
- **Outcome**: Developed comprehensive prompt engineering for technical specification processing
- **Breakthrough**: Created specialized prompts for different product categories with consistent pipe-separated formatting
- **Errors Fixed**: None - prompt design was effective from start
- **Code Changes**: Integrated prompt templates into enhance_specifications.py
- **Next Dependencies**: Enables consistent, high-quality AI enhancement across all products

### [2025-01-21 23:11] Task Completed: Implement specification enhancement logic
- **Outcome**: Created enhance_specifications.py with sample/test/full modes, processed 46 products with 100% success rate
- **Breakthrough**: Multi-mode processing system allows safe testing and gradual deployment
- **Errors Fixed**: Implemented proper rate limiting and error handling for API calls
- **Code Changes**: Created enhance_specifications.py with comprehensive enhancement engine
- **Next Dependencies**: Enables bulk processing of entire product catalog

### [2025-01-21 23:11] Task Completed: Process and reformat pipe-separated values
- **Outcome**: Successfully converted all specifications to consistent pipe-separated format with enhanced technical details
- **Breakthrough**: Standardized format improves readability and professional appearance
- **Errors Fixed**: Handled various input formats and edge cases in specification data
- **Code Changes**: Enhanced processing logic in enhance_specifications.py
- **Next Dependencies**: Provides clean, consistent data for brochure generation

### [2025-01-21 23:11] Task Completed: Update hierarchical JSON and regenerate brochure
- **Outcome**: Updated cli.py to use enhanced data, regenerated brochure with improved specifications
- **Breakthrough**: Seamless integration with existing brochure system, no breaking changes
- **Errors Fixed**: None - smooth integration with existing codebase
- **Code Changes**: Modified brochure/cli.py, created products_hierarchical_enhanced.json
- **Next Dependencies**: Project complete - enhanced brochure ready for use

### [2025-08-27 15:40] Task Completed: Expand metadata fields for improved categorization and searchability
- **Outcome**: Analyzed 46 products across 15 categories, identified 21 current fields and enhancement opportunities
- **Breakthrough**: Systematic analysis revealing 10 enhancement opportunities, 12 proposed new fields, and 4-phase implementation plan
- **Errors Fixed**: JSON structure parsing (KeyError: 'products')
- **Code Changes**: Created expand_metadata_fields.py, generated analysis reports
- **Next Dependencies**: Roadmap for improved categorization and search

### [2025-01-21 23:45] Task Completed: Repository cleanup and organization
- **Outcome**: Completely reorganized project structure with proper directory hierarchy (scripts/, data/, reports/, docs/)
- **Breakthrough**: Clean separation of concerns - scripts, data, reports, and documentation now properly organized
- **Errors Fixed**: Updated import paths in CLI to reflect new data/ directory structure
- **Code Changes**: Created organized directories, moved 8 analysis scripts to scripts/, moved 10 data files to data/, moved 6 reports to reports/, updated brochure/cli.py default path, created .gitignore, updated README.md with new structure
- **Next Dependencies**: Maintainable codebase ready for future development and collaboration
- **Errors Fixed**: Corrected JSON structure parsing to handle categories.products hierarchy
- **Code Changes**: Created expand_metadata_fields.py, generated metadata_enhancement_analysis.json and metadata_enhancement_summary.md
- **Next Dependencies**: Provides roadmap for improved product categorization, search functionality, and user experience enhancements
