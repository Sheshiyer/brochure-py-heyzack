- **Next Dependencies**: System ready for production use

### [2025-01-21 18:35] Task Completed: prepare-s3-upload-framework
- **Outcome**: Successfully integrated S3 upload framework into google_nano_image_generator.py
- **Breakthrough**: Created flexible cloud storage architecture that can be enabled/disabled via configuration
- **Code Changes**: Added S3 configuration variables, boto3 client initialization, upload methods, and metadata updates
- **Features Added**: 
  - S3 client initialization with error handling
  - Image upload with public-read ACL
  - Automatic S3 URL generation and metadata updates
  - Graceful fallback when S3 is disabled or credentials missing
- **Testing**: Verified existing functionality remains intact with S3 framework disabled
- **Next Dependencies**: Framework ready for future activation when AWS credentials are configured

## Key Breakthroughs
1. **Real AI Integration**: Successfully implemented Google Gemini 2.5 Flash Image Preview for authentic product imagery
2. **Multimodal Processing**: Achieved text + image input processing for contextual product scenarios
3. **Template Issue Resolution**: Identified and fixed placeholder generation problem
4. **Modular Architecture**: Created extensible system supporting multiple output formats and storage options
5. **Cloud-Ready Framework**: Implemented S3 upload capability for scalable deployment

## Error Patterns & Solutions
1. **google.genai Configuration**: Module structure changed - removed global configure() calls
2. **API Response Processing**: Base64 image data requires proper decoding and format handling
3. **Import Dependencies**: google-genai library installation required for Gemini API access
4. **File Path Management**: Used pathlib.Path for cross-platform compatibility
5. **Indentation Errors**: Fixed Python syntax issues during S3 framework integration

## Architecture Decisions
- **Google Gemini 2.5 Flash Image Preview**: Selected for real AI image generation due to its multimodal capabilities (text + image input)
- **Local Storage First**: Images saved locally with systematic naming convention (use-case-{model_id}.{extension})
- **Comprehensive Metadata**: Each generated image includes JSON metadata with generation details, prompts, and API responses
- **Error Handling**: Robust retry mechanism with exponential backoff for API failures
- **Modular Design**: Separate methods for prompt generation, API calls, image processing, and metadata management
- **S3 Upload Framework**: Implemented optional S3 upload capability (disabled by default) for future cloud storage needs
- **Configuration-Driven**: S3 upload can be enabled/disabled via ENABLE_S3_UPLOAD flag
- **Security-Conscious**: AWS credentials configurable separately from main code
